# Square Slayer

## Premise
This game is about survival as much as it's about Slaying Squares. Use arrowkeys to dodge squares and position yourself, or use an ability if the time is right. The more squares you slay without taking damage, the higher your multiplier. Hit multiple squares with a single ability to get a much larger multiplier gain. Every square slain is a win - take as many down with you as you can. How long can you survive? How many squares can you slay before they slay you?

## Future Directions
1. High Score file.
2. New purple exploding square that sends small fragment squares bouncing around briefly.
3. New giant real-time tracking square that is fast in X component and too slow in the Y component (overshoots), like a charging bull.
4. Power-ups that reduce cooldown on abilities or increase player stats.
5. Alternative styling with borders and gradients.
