# Square Slayer

## Premise
This game is about survival as much as it's about Slaying Squares. Use arrowkeys to dodge squares and position yourself, then use an ability to Slay some Squares. The more Squares you Slay without taking damage, the higher your multiplier. Hit multiple squares with a single ability to get a much larger multiplier gain. Every Square slain is a win - take as many down with you as you can. How long can you survive? How many squares can you slay before they slay you?

## Future Directions
1. High Score file.
2. Purple exploding square that emits particles.
3. Giant real-time tracking square that is fast in X component and too slow in the Y component(overshoots), like a charging bull.
4. Powerups that reduce cooldown on detonate/jumpback, increase player speed/health.
5. Styling Squares, borders, gradients.
